#### Scraping and Scrobbling

Scraping and scrobbling features rely on external services such as **TMDb** (https://www.themoviedb.org/), **TheTVDB** (http://thetvdb.com/) and **Trakt** (https://trakt.tv).

In order to enable NOVA video player to perform these tasks you need to register to this services and enable the API and inject the corresponding keys inside the following files: *MediaLib/src/community/res/values/donottranslate.xml*
replacing the fake values below:
```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <resources xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
        <string name="tvdb_api_key">0123456789ABCDEF</string>
        <string name="tmdb_api_key">0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef</string>
        <string name="trakt_api_key">0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef</string>
        <string name="trakt_api_secret">0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef</string>
    </resources>
```
